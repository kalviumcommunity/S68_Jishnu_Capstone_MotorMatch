🚗 MotorMatch – Capstone Project ⚡

🧠 Project Idea
MotorMatch is a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) vehicle-selling platform that connects buyers directly with sellers — completely eliminating third-party intermediaries or dealers. The goal is to build a secure, easy-to-use full-stack web app where individuals can list, browse, and buy vehicles while communicating directly with each other.

🔑 Key Features:
JWT-based user authentication

Seller dashboard to manage vehicle listings

Search and filtering for buyers

Direct in-app messaging between buyer and seller

Wishlist, ratings, and reviews

No admin approval or dealer involvement — 100% peer-to-peer
