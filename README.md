# 🚗 MotorMatch - Capstone Project ⚡

## 🧠 Project Idea

**MotorMatch** is a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) vehicle-selling platform that connects buyers directly with sellers — completely eliminating third-party intermediaries or dealers. The goal is to build a secure, easy-to-use full-stack web app where individuals can list, browse, and buy vehicles while communicating directly with each other.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- JWT-based user authentication
- Seller dashboard to manage vehicle listings
- Search and filtering for buyers
- Direct in-app messaging between buyer and seller
- Wishlist, ratings, and reviews 
- No admin approval or dealer involvement — 100% peer-to-peer
